/**435. Non-overlapping Intervals
 * Given an array of intervals intervals where intervals[i] = [starti, endi], return the minimum number of intervals you need to remove to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.
 *
 * Note that intervals which only touch at a point are non-overlapping. For example, [1, 2] and [2, 3] are non-overlapping.
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: intervals = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[1,3]]
 * Output: 1
 * Explanation: [1,3] can be removed and the rest of the intervals are non-overlapping.
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: intervals = [[1,2],[1,2],[1,2]]
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: You need to remove two [1,2] to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.
 * Example 3:
 *
 * Input: intervals = [[1,2],[2,3]]
 * Output: 0
 * Explanation: You don't need to remove any of the intervals since they're already non-overlapping.
