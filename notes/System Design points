Distributed locking is a technique used in distributed systems to ensure that only one process (or thread)
can access a shared resource at a time, across multiple nodes or services. It is crucial when coordinating acces
s to resources like databases, files, or caches to prevent race conditions and maintain data consistency.

🔐 Why Use Distributed Locking?

In a multi-instance or microservices environment, traditional in-memory locks
(like Java synchronized or ReentrantLock)
won’t work across different nodes. Distributed locking ensures mutual exclusion across a cluster.

🔧 Common Distributed Lock Implementations

1. Using Redis (RedLock Algorithm)
	•	Tools: Redisson, lettuce
	•	Pros: Fast, easy to integrate
	•	Example (Redisson in Java):
	RLock lock = redissonClient.getLock("my-lock");
    try {
        if (lock.tryLock(10, 60, TimeUnit.SECONDS)) {
            // Critical section
        }
    } finally {
        lock.unlock();
    }

    2. Using Zookeeper
    	•	Tools: Apache Curator
    	•	Zookeeper uses ephemeral znodes to implement locks.
    	•	Very consistent and reliable.
    	•	Example (Curator):
    	InterProcessMutex lock = new InterProcessMutex(client, "/mylock");
        if (lock.acquire(10, TimeUnit.SECONDS)) {
            try {
                // Critical section
            } finally {
                lock.release();
            }
        }

        3. Using Databases (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle)
        	•	Use SELECT ... FOR UPDATE, or application-level lock tables
        	•	Slower and less scalable, but acceptable for simple needs
        	•	Example:
        	SELECT * FROM locks WHERE name = 'my_lock' FOR UPDATE;




2. Design an E-commerce System (like Amazon)

Core Components:
	•	User management
	•	Product catalog
	•	Shopping cart
	•	Order management
	•	Payment handling

Answer:
	•	Microservices approach using Spring Boot:
	•	UserService, ProductService, CartService, OrderService, PaymentService
	•	Use Kafka for event-driven architecture (e.g., after payment, trigger shipping)
	•	Database:
	•	PostgreSQL for structured data
	•	Elasticsearch for product search
	•	Redis for cart caching
	•	Concurrency Handling:
	•	Use optimistic locking (JPA @Version) for inventory updates
	•	Use distributed locks (Redisson) to prevent over-ordering
	•	Scalability:
	•	Stateless services with Kubernetes
	•	API Gateway + Service Registry (Spring Cloud Netflix stack)

3. Design a Rate Limiter

Requirements:
	•	Limit number of API requests per user per minute

Answer:
	•	Algorithms:
	•	Token Bucket or Leaky Bucket
	•	Use Redis with TTL:
	•	Store {user_id}:{timestamp} keys
	•	Use Redis atomic increment and expire
	•	Java Stack:
	•	Spring Boot interceptor or filter
	•	RedisTemplate for accessing Redis
	•	Use Bucket4j library for in-memory or distributed rate limiting

⸻

4. Design a Chat System (like WhatsApp or Slack)

Requirements:
	•	1:1 and group chats
	•	Message history
	•	Online status

Answer:
	•	Services:
	•	ChatService, UserService, MessageService, NotificationService
	•	Use WebSocket (Spring WebSocket) or STOMP over WebSocket for real-time communication
	•	Use MongoDB for storing messages (due to its document-based nature)
	•	Kafka for async delivery and notifications
	•	Redis pub/sub for online status tracking

⸻

5. Design a Logging System

Requirements:
	•	Collect logs from various applications
	•	Search logs by time, service, severity

Answer:
	•	Log ingestion:
	•	Services log to Kafka topics
	•	Consumers write to Elasticsearch
	•	Frontend to query logs (Kibana or custom Spring Boot API)
	•	Storage: Elasticsearch for fast indexing
	•	Use Fluentd or Logstash as collectors

⸻

6. Design a File Storage System (like Google Drive)

Requirements:
	•	Upload, download, share files
	•	Folder hierarchy
	•	Versioning

Answer:
	•	Use Spring Boot for APIs
	•	Files stored in AWS S3 or on a blob store
	•	Metadata (ownership, versions, path) stored in PostgreSQL
	•	Share via pre-signed URLs
	•	Use @PreAuthorize and @PostAuthorize (Spring Security) for access control
	•	Versioning via a separate table or S3 versioning

⸻

7. Design a Notification System (Email/SMS/Push)

Answer:
	•	Components:
	•	NotificationService
	•	TemplatesService
	•	QueueProcessor
	•	Use Spring Boot with RabbitMQ/Kafka
	•	Async delivery using background workers
	•	Fallback mechanism (e.g., retry with exponential backoff)
	•	Store preferences per user (email/sms/push) in DB
