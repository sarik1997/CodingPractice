Distributed locking is a technique used in distributed systems to ensure that only one process (or thread) can access a shared resource at a time, across multiple nodes or services. It is crucial when coordinating access to resources like databases, files, or caches to prevent race conditions and maintain data consistency.

üîê Why Use Distributed Locking?

In a multi-instance or microservices environment, traditional in-memory locks (like Java synchronized or ReentrantLock) won‚Äôt work across different nodes. Distributed locking ensures mutual exclusion across a cluster.

üîß Common Distributed Lock Implementations

1. Using Redis (RedLock Algorithm)
	‚Ä¢	Tools: Redisson, lettuce
	‚Ä¢	Pros: Fast, easy to integrate
	‚Ä¢	Example (Redisson in Java):
	RLock lock = redissonClient.getLock("my-lock");
    try {
        if (lock.tryLock(10, 60, TimeUnit.SECONDS)) {
            // Critical section
        }
    } finally {
        lock.unlock();
    }

    2. Using Zookeeper
    	‚Ä¢	Tools: Apache Curator
    	‚Ä¢	Zookeeper uses ephemeral znodes to implement locks.
    	‚Ä¢	Very consistent and reliable.
    	‚Ä¢	Example (Curator):
    	InterProcessMutex lock = new InterProcessMutex(client, "/mylock");
        if (lock.acquire(10, TimeUnit.SECONDS)) {
            try {
                // Critical section
            } finally {
                lock.release();
            }
        }

        3. Using Databases (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle)
        	‚Ä¢	Use SELECT ... FOR UPDATE, or application-level lock tables
        	‚Ä¢	Slower and less scalable, but acceptable for simple needs
        	‚Ä¢	Example:
        	SELECT * FROM locks WHERE name = 'my_lock' FOR UPDATE;




2. Design an E-commerce System (like Amazon)

Core Components:
	‚Ä¢	User management
	‚Ä¢	Product catalog
	‚Ä¢	Shopping cart
	‚Ä¢	Order management
	‚Ä¢	Payment handling

Answer:
	‚Ä¢	Microservices approach using Spring Boot:
	‚Ä¢	UserService, ProductService, CartService, OrderService, PaymentService
	‚Ä¢	Use Kafka for event-driven architecture (e.g., after payment, trigger shipping)
	‚Ä¢	Database:
	‚Ä¢	PostgreSQL for structured data
	‚Ä¢	Elasticsearch for product search
	‚Ä¢	Redis for cart caching
	‚Ä¢	Concurrency Handling:
	‚Ä¢	Use optimistic locking (JPA @Version) for inventory updates
	‚Ä¢	Use distributed locks (Redisson) to prevent over-ordering
	‚Ä¢	Scalability:
	‚Ä¢	Stateless services with Kubernetes
	‚Ä¢	API Gateway + Service Registry (Spring Cloud Netflix stack)

3. Design a Rate Limiter

Requirements:
	‚Ä¢	Limit number of API requests per user per minute

Answer:
	‚Ä¢	Algorithms:
	‚Ä¢	Token Bucket or Leaky Bucket
	‚Ä¢	Use Redis with TTL:
	‚Ä¢	Store {user_id}:{timestamp} keys
	‚Ä¢	Use Redis atomic increment and expire
	‚Ä¢	Java Stack:
	‚Ä¢	Spring Boot interceptor or filter
	‚Ä¢	RedisTemplate for accessing Redis
	‚Ä¢	Use Bucket4j library for in-memory or distributed rate limiting

4. Design a Chat System (like WhatsApp or Slack)

Requirements:
	‚Ä¢	1:1 and group chats
	‚Ä¢	Message history
	‚Ä¢	Online status

Answer:
	‚Ä¢	Services:
	‚Ä¢	ChatService, UserService, MessageService, NotificationService
	‚Ä¢	Use WebSocket (Spring WebSocket) or STOMP over WebSocket for real-time communication
	‚Ä¢	Use MongoDB for storing messages (due to its document-based nature)
	‚Ä¢	Kafka for async delivery and notifications
	‚Ä¢	Redis pub/sub for online status tracking

5. Design a Logging System

Requirements:
	‚Ä¢	Collect logs from various applications
	‚Ä¢	Search logs by time, service, severity

Answer:
	‚Ä¢	Log ingestion:
	‚Ä¢	Services log to Kafka topics
	‚Ä¢	Consumers write to Elasticsearch
	‚Ä¢	Frontend to query logs (Kibana or custom Spring Boot API)
	‚Ä¢	Storage: Elasticsearch for fast indexing
	‚Ä¢	Use Fluentd or Logstash as collectors

6. Design a File Storage System (like Google Drive)

Requirements:
	‚Ä¢	Upload, download, share files
	‚Ä¢	Folder hierarchy
	‚Ä¢	Versioning

Answer:
	‚Ä¢	Use Spring Boot for APIs
	‚Ä¢	Files stored in AWS S3 or on a blob store
	‚Ä¢	Metadata (ownership, versions, path) stored in PostgreSQL
	‚Ä¢	Share via pre-signed URLs
	‚Ä¢	Use @PreAuthorize and @PostAuthorize (Spring Security) for access control
	‚Ä¢	Versioning via a separate table or S3 versioning

7. Design a Notification System (Email/SMS/Push)

Answer:
	‚Ä¢	Components:
	‚Ä¢	NotificationService
	‚Ä¢	TemplatesService
	‚Ä¢	QueueProcessor
	‚Ä¢	Use Spring Boot with RabbitMQ/Kafka
	‚Ä¢	Async delivery using background workers
	‚Ä¢	Fallback mechanism (e.g., retry with exponential backoff)
	‚Ä¢	Store preferences per user (email/sms/push) in DB
