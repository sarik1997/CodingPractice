Distributed locking is a technique used in distributed systems to ensure that only one process (or thread) can access a shared resource at a time, across multiple nodes or services. It is crucial when coordinating access to resources like databases, files, or caches to prevent race conditions and maintain data consistency.

üîê Why Use Distributed Locking?

In a multi-instance or microservices environment, traditional in-memory locks (like Java synchronized or ReentrantLock) won‚Äôt work across different nodes. Distributed locking ensures mutual exclusion across a cluster.

üîß Common Distributed Lock Implementations

1. Using Redis (RedLock Algorithm)
	‚Ä¢	Tools: Redisson, lettuce
	‚Ä¢	Pros: Fast, easy to integrate
	‚Ä¢	Example (Redisson in Java):
	RLock lock = redissonClient.getLock("my-lock");
    try {
        if (lock.tryLock(10, 60, TimeUnit.SECONDS)) {
            // Critical section
        }
    } finally {
        lock.unlock();
    }

    2. Using Zookeeper
    	‚Ä¢	Tools: Apache Curator
    	‚Ä¢	Zookeeper uses ephemeral znodes to implement locks.
    	‚Ä¢	Very consistent and reliable.
    	‚Ä¢	Example (Curator):
    	InterProcessMutex lock = new InterProcessMutex(client, "/mylock");
        if (lock.acquire(10, TimeUnit.SECONDS)) {
            try {
                // Critical section
            } finally {
                lock.release();
            }
        }

        3. Using Databases (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle)
        	‚Ä¢	Use SELECT ... FOR UPDATE, or application-level lock tables
        	‚Ä¢	Slower and less scalable, but acceptable for simple needs
        	‚Ä¢	Example:
        	SELECT * FROM locks WHERE name = 'my_lock' FOR UPDATE;
