Thread :- A thread is the smallest unit of execution in a process.
 A process can have multiple threads running concurrently.

Main Thread:- When a program starts, one thread is automatically created — the main thread.

Creating Threads :-
There are different ways to create threads depending on the language. In Java, for instance:
	•	By extending the Thread class.
	•	By implementing the Runnable interface.
	•	Using thread pools (ExecutorService).
☕ Java Multithreading Examples

✅ Example 1: Extending Thread class
class MyThread extends Thread {
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Thread running: " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyThread t1 = new MyThread();
        t1.start();  // start() calls run() internally on a new thread
        System.out.println("Main thread: " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
    }
}
✅ Example 2: Implementing Runnable interface
class MyRunnable implements Runnable {
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Running in: " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Thread t1 = new Thread(new MyRunnable());
        t1.start();
        System.out.println("Main thread: " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
    }
}
✅ Example 3: Using ExecutorService (Thread Pool)
import java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService;
import java.util.concurrent.Executors;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(2);

        Runnable task = () -> System.out.println("Running in thread: " + Thread.currentThread().getName());

        executor.submit(task);
        executor.submit(task);

        executor.shutdown(); // Don't forget to shut it down!
    }
}

🔸 With join() — Main thread waits
class MyRunnable implements Runnable {
    @Override
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Thread is running...");
        try {
            Thread.sleep(100); // Simulate some work
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
        System.out.println("Thread is done.");
    }
}

public class JoinExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Thread t1 = new Thread(new MyRunnable());
        t1.start();

        try {
            t1.join(); // Main thread waits for t1 to finish
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }

        System.out.println("Main thread continues...");
    }
}
🔹 Output (deterministic):
Thread is running...
Thread is done.
Main thread continues...
🧠 Explanation: join() blocks the main thread until t1 finishes.
t1.join() → Now the main thread pauses and waits for t1 to finish.

Description
Concurrency             Multiple tasks make progress, possibly overlapping in time.
Parallelism             Tasks run at the same time, often on multiple CPU cores.
Synchronization         Ensuring only one thread accesses critical code/data at a time.
Race Condition          Bug where threads access shared data in an unsafe way.
Deadlock                Two or more threads are blocked forever, each waiting for the other.
Thread-safe             Code that functions correctly when multiple threads access it concurrently.

if a RuntimeException is thrown inside the run() method of a Runnable,
 it will not affect the main thread, and execution will continue after calling t1.start().
 The exception will be uncaught unless explicitly handled inside the run() method.

Example:
class MyRunnable implements Runnable {
    @Override
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Thread is running...");
        throw new RuntimeException("Exception in thread");
    }
}

public class RunnableExceptionTest {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Thread t1 = new Thread(new MyRunnable());
        t1.start();

        System.out.println("Main thread continues...");
    }
}
output:
Main thread continues...
Thread is running...
Exception in thread "Thread-0" java.lang.RuntimeException: Exception in thread
    at MyRunnable.run(RunnableExceptionTest.java:5)
    at java.base/java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:833)


    import java.util.concurrent.*;
    import java.util.*;

    public class Concurrent2DSum {
        public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException, ExecutionException {
            int[][] matrix = {
                {1, 2, 3},
                {4, 5, 6},
                {7, 8, 9}
            };

            ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(matrix.length);
            List<Future<Integer>> futures = new ArrayList<>();

            // Submit one task per row
            for (int[] row : matrix) {
                Callable<Integer> task = () -> {
                    int sum = 0;
                    for (int num : row) {
                        sum += num;
                    }
                    return sum;
                };
                futures.add(executor.submit(task));
            }

            // Get the results
            int rowNum = 0;
            for (Future<Integer> future : futures) {
                System.out.println("Row " + rowNum++ + " sum: " + future.get());
            }

            executor.shutdown();
        }
    }

    Virtual threads are a lightweight concurrency feature introduced in Java 21 (finalized as stable)
    as part of Project Loom. They enable you to write high-throughput, scalable concurrent applications
    with a thread-per-task model—without the performance and resource costs of traditional platform (OS) threads.

    ⸻

    🧵 What Are Virtual Threads?
    	•	Virtual threads are user-mode threads managed by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), not the OS.
    	•	They are scheduled by the JVM on a small pool of underlying carrier (platform) threads.
    	•	Each virtual thread can be blocked or suspended without blocking an actual OS thread.

    ⸻

    🆚 Virtual Threads vs Platform Threads
    Feature             Virtual Thread                      Platform (OS) Thread
    Managed by          JVM                                 Operating System
    Blocking operations Cheap                               Expensive (blocks OS threads)
    Resource cost       Very low (thousands possible)       High (hundreds typical)
    Use case            Massive concurrency (e.g. I/O)      CPU-intensive tasks

✅ Benefits
	•	Simpler concurrency model (thread-per-request).
	•	Scalable like asynchronous code, without callbacks or reactive complexity.
	•	Works with existing java.util.concurrent APIs and frameworks.

🚀 How to Use Virtual Threads (Java 21+)

Create a Virtual Thread:
Thread.startVirtualThread(() -> {
    System.out.println("Running in a virtual thread: " + Thread.currentThread());
});

With ExecutorService:
ExecutorService executor = Executors.newVirtualThreadPerTaskExecutor();

executor.submit(() -> {
    // Lightweight blocking task
    Thread.sleep(1000);
    return "Done";
});

executor.shutdown();

✅ What is a Future in Java?

A Future represents the result of an asynchronous computation. It’s like a placeholder for a value that will be available later, after a background task finishes.

📦 Key methods of Future:
	•	get(): Waits (blocks) until the result is ready, then returns it.
	•	isDone(): Returns true if the task is finished.
	•	cancel(boolean mayInterruptIfRunning): Tries to stop the task.

⸻

✅ Example:
ExecutorService executor = Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor();

Future<Integer> future = executor.submit(() -> {
    Thread.sleep(1000);
    return 42;
});

System.out.println("Waiting...");
int result = future.get(); // blocks until result is ready
System.out.println("Result: " + result);

executor.shutdown();

Feature                                          Runnable                                                    Callable<V>
Returns a value                                  ❌ No                                                       ✅ Yes (V is the return type)
Throws checked exceptions                        ❌ No (must handle inside)                                  ✅ Yes (can throw checked exceptions)
Submit with                                      ExecutorService.submit(Runnable)                            ExecutorService.submit(Callable)
Result with                                      N/A                                                         Future<V>


⸻

🔧 Example:

Runnable (no result):
Runnable task = () -> System.out.println("No return");
executor.submit(task);

Callable (returns value):
Callable<Integer> task = () -> 5 + 5;
Future<Integer> result = executor.submit(task);
🧠 When to use what?
	•	Use Runnable when you just want to run something in parallel without needing a result.
	•	Use Callable when you need to get a result or handle exceptions properly.



✅ Use ExecutorService with Callable
 	•	Submit 5 tasks (each for one file).
 	•	Use Future to collect results.
 	•	Wait for all to complete.
 	•	Merge the output.

public class FileProcessor {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(5); // 5 threads

        // File paths to process
        List<String> filePaths = List.of("file1.txt", "file2.txt", "file3.txt", "file4.txt", "file5.txt");

        // Submit tasks
        List<Future<List<String>>> futures = new ArrayList<>();
        for (String path : filePaths) {
            futures.add(executor.submit(() -> processFile(path)));
        }

        // Collect and merge results
        List<String> mergedResults = new ArrayList<>();
        for (Future<List<String>> future : futures) {
            mergedResults.addAll(future.get()); // get() blocks until task finishes
        }

        // Optionally write to consolidated file
        try (BufferedWriter writer = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter("output.txt"))) {
            for (String line : mergedResults) {
                writer.write(line);
                writer.newLine();
            }
        }

        executor.shutdown();
        System.out.println("All files processed and consolidated.");
    }

    // Dummy file processor that reads lines into a list
    public static List<String> processFile(String filePath) throws IOException {
        List<String> lines = new ArrayList<>();
        try (BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(filePath))) {
            String line;
            while ((line = reader.readLine()) != null) {
                lines.add(line); // or transform/process as needed
            }
        }
        return lines;
    }
}

🚀 Key Concepts:
	•	ExecutorService: manages threads.
	•	Callable + Future: handles return values.
	•	future.get(): blocks until task is done.
	•	shutdown(): gracefully closes thread pool.
