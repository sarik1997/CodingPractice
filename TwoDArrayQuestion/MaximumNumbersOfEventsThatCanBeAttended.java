/**Maximum Number of Events That Can Be Attended
 * You are given an array of events where events[i] = [startDayi, endDayi]. Every event i starts at startDayi and ends at endDayi.
 * You can attend an event i at any day d where startTimei <= d <= endTimei. You can only attend one event at any time d.
 * Return the maximum number of events you can attend.
 * Example 1:
 * Input: events = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4]]
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: You can attend all the three events.
 * One way to attend them all is as shown.
 * Attend the first event on day 1.
 * Attend the second event on day 2.
 * Attend the third event on day 3.
 * Example 2:
 * Input: events= [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[1,2]]
 * Output: 4
